    "Help": "There is a public call for Sustainable Palm Oil from consumers in pulp and paper industry. \n\nThe Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was established in 2004 with the objective of promoting the growth and use of such sustainable oil palm products through credible global standards and engagement of stakeholders. Around 800 Members form different sectors of the palm oil industry (oil palm producers, palm oil processors or traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, banks and investors, environmental or nature conservation NGOs and social or developmental NGOs) are engaged together. The principles aim to ensure that the farming of palm oil products is compatible with the protection of rain forest and biodiversity within the rain forest. \nThe use of certified sustainable sources for palm oil is an integral part of a sustainable business strategy. \n\nWith “certified supplier” we refer to companies whose operations have been certified against either the RSPO Supply Chain Certification Standard or against the RSPO Principles and Criteria Standard.\n\nhttps://rspo.org/members/all\n\nWith “certified material” we refer exclusively to materials that meet the criteria of RSPO Certified Volume (CSPO). (identity preserved or segregated or mass-balanced)\n\nShould your company be a RSPO certificate holder for the product as supplied, feel free to upload a copy of the certificate as an additional document.\nShould you apply any other risk assessment methodology we encourage you to either describe it in the comment field or to upload an additional document about it.",
