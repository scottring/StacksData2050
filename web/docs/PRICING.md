# Stacks Data Pricing Structure
## Draft v1.0 - December 2024

---

## Pricing Philosophy

Based on competitor research ([EcoVadis](https://ecovadis.com/plans-pricing/), [Sedex](https://www.sedex.com/become-a-member/supplier-membership/), [ProcessUnity](https://www.processunity.com/vendor-risk-management/)):

1. **Free tier attracts suppliers** - Maximize network coverage
2. **Usage-based upgrades** - Pay more as you use more
3. **Feature-based tiers** - Premium features unlock at higher tiers
4. **Enterprise = custom** - Large orgs get white-glove treatment

---
